The xunit style of test frameworks has been around for decades, but due to JavaScript's origins and history, up until recent years, it's never really had the language support to be able to match the features of these other tools.

That all changed with the creation of TypeScript, and now teams can benefit from adopting common practices and patterns across technology stacks.

xunit.ts was created because this commonality was missing from apps that used TypeScript/JavaScript on the front-end, and another language on the back-end.

ecoAPM now uses xunit.ts exclusively for testing all our front-end applications.
