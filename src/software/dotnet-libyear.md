Created by fellow software developer and Ithacan [Jared Beck](https://jaredbeck.com), a [libyear](https://libyear.com) is a unit of measurement to help you determine how up-to-date (or out-of-date) your application's dependencies are.

ecoAPM maintains the [PHP](/software/php-libyear) and .NET flavors of the libyear calculators, which are backed by Composer and NuGet, respectively.
