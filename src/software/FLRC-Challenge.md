The COVID pandemic brought about many necessary changes for many different industries, and race organization was no different.

Unable to safely hold in-person races, the [Finger Lakes Running Club](https://fingerlakesrunners.org) created a year-long self-timed challenge across 10 local courses.

Using this dashboard app, local athletes can check on their aggregated results, compare their times against other runners, and even find running partners based on similar paces. Results are streamed in near real-time using [WebScorer](https://webscorer.com)'s API, and all data storage and calculations happen in-memory, so everyone always sees the most up-to-date numbers in the blink of an eye.

ecoAPM has donated about 100 hours to building, maintaining, and improving this web app throughout 2020 and 2021.
