Age grading is an important metric to create more equitable comparisons between athletes across age groups and gender-based categories.

The complete age grade tables used by the [USATF](https://usatf.org) have been added as an in-memory dataset, and fast lookup and linear interpretation methods have been implemented for efficient calculation of age grades for any athlete at any distance.

This library was built and open-sourced as part of the [FLRC's Challenge Dashboard](/software/FLRC-Challenge).
