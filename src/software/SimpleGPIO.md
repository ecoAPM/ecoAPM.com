Interacting directly with hardware over GPIO ports has never been easy or straightforward, since most of the software libraries are available are too low-level for younger or more junior developers to fully grasp.

SimpleGPIO aims to make IoT programming easier by providing a more natural language API, so developers can focus on their intended functionality and logic, not boilerplate and housekeeping.
