Wi-Fi Surveyor is a tool to help you visualize Wi-Fi signal strength over a geographic area, indoors or outdoors.

Wi-Fi Surveyor records signals from all available access points at a given location, so you can aggregate or dive deep into detailed signal data either while you're out in the field, or after you've finished your survey.
