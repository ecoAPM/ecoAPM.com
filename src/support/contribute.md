#### Commission a Feature or Bug Fix

#### Support Subscriptions

Purchasing a [support subscription](/support/subscriptions) is one of the most effective ways to ensure someone's always got your back when you're looking for help.

Check out the [Support Subscriptions](/support/subscriptions) page for more details.

#### Contribute to Code or Documentation

All of our software is open source for a reason: the best software is built by teams and communities, when a diverse set of individuals and backgrounds come together for a common cause.

If you have an idea for a new feature, great! Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/ecoAPM) and start a discussion in the relevant repository.

If you want to help fix a bug, implement something new, or add to our documentation even better! We'll figure out the details on the issue and work through getting that PR merged together.
