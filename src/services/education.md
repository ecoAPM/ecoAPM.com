#### Performance Education

Software development teams have a lot they need to keep track of as they build and maintain their applications.

Performance is an important aspect of any software system, yet is often an afterthought unless something is actively causing problems.

We educate dev teams on modern performance practices, from both a proactive and remedial standpoint.

We like to take a language/framework-agnostic approach, as the biggest gains are often realized regardless of what specific technologies are being used, but are happy to tailor one or more sessions to meet the team where they're at.
